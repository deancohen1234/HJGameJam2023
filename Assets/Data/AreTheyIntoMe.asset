  openingDialogueText: I need to know if the girl I'm interested in shares the same
    feeling. I can't risk the embaressment of being rejected! Is she interested me?
  response1: This girl is not interested in you I'm afraid. Best if you just kept
    your distance.
  response2: She has been harboring your feelings of love for a long time it seems.
    I'd say now is your moment to tell her how you feel.
  response3: She is interested... however I warn you I see strife and hardship in
    your future. This relationship will not end well.
  correctReadingResponse: <shake>WHAT??</shake> I don't want that. There was always
    a little nagging in the back of my mind that something was off. I will just stay
    friends then!
  incorrectReadingResponse: No no no that just can't be right, something just feels
    <wave>off</wave>. Guess I wil try another seer in the next town over.
