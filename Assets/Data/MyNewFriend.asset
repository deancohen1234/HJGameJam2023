  openingDialogueText: I found this rabbit in my house. It won't leave my house.
    It's very cute but I just don't know if this is the right decision for me right
    now.
  response1: There is a powerful bond that is between you two. It is rare and should
    be cherished and nurtured. You and this rabbit are meant to be together.
  response2: This rabbit carries a dark energy about it. It must be put as far from
    you as possible. It will only lead to ruin.
  response3: Somone else in this world needs this creature, more than you. Search
    them out, you will be rewarded for it.
  correctReadingResponse: I knew this wasn't just a conincidence. Me and <rainb>Shruggles</rainb>
    will be together forever!
  incorrectReadingResponse: Awww I really though me and <rainb>Shruggles</rainb>
