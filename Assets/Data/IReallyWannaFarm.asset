  openingDialogueText: This is gonna sound crazy, but I saw a plot of farmland on
    my way to work and I just got this feeling I should drop everything to make it
    my own. But I need to know if it's gonna work out!
  response1: I see riches and prosperity ahead of you. I believe this farm is your
    catalyst.
  response2: Rags and struggle are in your future. This farm will lead you to ruin.
  response3: You have a bright future, but not at this farm. You must wait until
    another opportunity arises.
