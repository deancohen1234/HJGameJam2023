  openingDialogueText: I'm never convinced you people can predict anything about
    some you don't know. But... I need clarity. I am training to become the greatest
    violinest in the world. And my audition is coming up. Tell me it's going to go
    well?
  response1: Love and life are in your future. This audition marks the beginning
    of a new age of passion and success for you.
  response2: Pain and suffering are at the end of this path you've chosen. It will
    consume you. You must give up on this dream. There are other ways to obtain the
    success you crave.
  response3: This audition will fail, but it will not be the end of your career.
    I see delayed success and achievement for you.
  correctReadingResponse: Oh my god... you are right... I have been focusing so much
    on my goal I never thought if I truly wanted it... I need to go and rethink my
    career... thank you.
  incorrectReadingResponse: Oh of course you would say that. You know nothing about
    me and are just making all this up!
